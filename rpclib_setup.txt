This file outlines how to setup the RPCLib library to run our PennCloud project.

1) Clone rpclib via https in the root dir (~/) of your computer. (https://github.com/rpclib/rpclib)
2) cd ~/rpclib
3) mkdir build
4) cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=output
5) make install
6) cd build
7) cmake ..
8) cd ..
9) cmake --build .

The ~/rpclib/output directory should contain the include/ and lib/ directories now.

10) cd into our submission directory (T20/)
11) run make in T20/rpcFrontend/ and in T20/rpcBackend/


If everything was set up correctly, you should see a "frontend" binary in T20/rpcFrontend and the binaries "masterNode",
"kvServer", "paxosServer", "testClient", and "paxosServer" in T20/rpcBackend/
